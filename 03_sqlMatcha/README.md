Once you have your tools installed, you're good to go. But first be sure to run `python3  DB_config/setUpMyDB.py`, and the script will take care of the work for you (including the insertion of dummy data).

##### 3rd; running the server :

You could run the server by simply running :

`python3 mainFn.py`

where 4000 is your port number.
